# buildabear

This semester, our project team each designed and developed their own personal website, ranging from art portfolio to travel websites!  For the first four weeks, we learned design principles and conducted design critiques to help each member iterate through their low to high fidelity wireframes on Figma.  In the last four weeks, we learned the principles of HTML, CSS, and React in order to develop the final designs.  Finally, we deployed our websites through Github Pages, and each member deployed their own public website.  Each member in Build-a-Bear worked hard all semester to create a personalized website about something they're passionate about!
